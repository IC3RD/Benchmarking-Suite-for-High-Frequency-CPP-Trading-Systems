Each component to test should have its own testing file. Start with making a testing fixture
This is a struct which is initialised and deleted before and after running each unit test
(although it can be a class instead of a struct since we don't need private members because we're only accessing components within the same testing module any encapsulation is unnecessary)

Then write your unit tests with the following format:
TEST_F(<FixtureName>, <UnitTestName>) 

Then build and make:
build (cmake --build build/)
make  (cmake --install build/)

To run all tests:
/bin/tests
To run all tests on a given fixture (eg Example unit tests)
/bin/tests --gtest_filter=ExampleTests*
To run a specific unit test of a fixture:
/bin/tests --gtest_filter=ExampleTests.AutoPass1
