# Set-Up and Prerequisites 
- Set as your python interpreter the venv folder in the root directory of the project
- Build the project as specified in the root directory `README.md` file
- Make sure to load (run) the `CMameLists.txt` file in the root directory to get the benchmarker executable
- Navigate to the CPP-design-pattern-for-low-latency/benchmarking directory before running the script
- Inside the `/benchmarking` directory there should be an empty `/outputs` folder; this is where all files generated by this
script will go

# Running the script 
- Run the script by executing `./benchmarking_script.py [args] [options]`
- The script is configured to be run with three different configurations (based on the number of arguments provided):
## Number of arguments:
### No arguments:
- Running the script without any arguments will simply run the benchmarking executable (results will be printed in terminal)

### One argument:
- Giving the script a file name as an argument will cause it to run the benchmarker and then compare the results with the
results in the given file. 
- The script produces a report which will be saved in the `/outputs` folder as a pdf.
- **Make sure the given file is in the `/outputs` folder**

### Two arguments:
- Giving the script two file names as arguments will cause it to compare the results of the given files.
- The script produces a report which will be saved in the `/outputs` folder as a pdf.
- **Make sure the given files are in the `/outputs` folder**

### Notes:
* Please make sure you run it at least once without arguments (to produce at least one file)
* The script is configured to work with files it has previously produced (to get the correct format), so do not try to 
run it with your own files.
* The naming conventions used are:
    * `benchmark_at[DATE_TIME]` for files produced by the benchmarker (json files)
    * `comparison_[FILE_1]_[FILE_2].pdf` for each report produced
      * here `FILE_1` and `FILE_2` are named as `benchamark_at[DATE_TIME]` as mentioned above

## Options:
* `-h` or `--help`: get help
* `-output-path OUTPUT_PATH` or `--out OUTPUT_PATH`: specify the path for the outputted files (default `/outputs`)
* `-input-path INPUT_PATH` or `--in INPUT_PATH`: specify the path for the input files (default `/outputs`)
